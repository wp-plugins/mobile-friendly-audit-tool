This WordPress plugin allows you to embed a frontend widget that tests a given website for mobile friendliness using Google's PageSpeed Insights API.

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin allows you to embed a frontend widget where the user can enter the full URL of the website to
test for mobile friendliness, and the results are displayed below. This widget uses Google's PageSpeed Insights API.

**NOTE: Make sure you enter your Google Apps API key into the settings area.**

The shortcode presents a basic HTML form that captures a URL. When the `Run Audit` button is pressed, the
form is hidden, and the loading UI displayed. When the PageSpeed API call returns, the information is
displayed in templated sections beneath.

##Usage
Simply embed the shortcode `[mobile_audit_form]` into any post content area, or HTML/Text widget.

###Options

####Debug output.
Use the `debug="true"` option to show debug output in the browsers JavaScript console.
E.g. `[mobile_audit_form debug="true"]`

####Hiding Result Sections
You can hide the one or more of the following sections via shortcode attributes:

* Overall: `[mobile_audit_form hide_overall="true"]`
* Recommendations: `[mobile_audit_form hide_recommendations="true"]`
* Statistics: `[mobile_audit_form hide_statistics="true"]`
* Resources: `[mobile_audit_form hide_resources="true"]`
* Preview: `[mobile_audit_form hide_preview="true"]`

##The Results

###Overall
The Overall section shows Google's mobile rating for both Speed and Usability, including a Google-o-meter chart.

###Recommendations
This section shows suggestions for improving the page ratings. Each entry is marked `pass`, `warning` or `fail`.

###Statistics
This section shows useful statistics related to the page request and response breakdowns by asset type.

###Resources
This is a pie chart showing the split between asset type, for the page response.

###Preview
This shows an image snapshot of the page, as Google sees it.

##Theming

All markup is provided via .php files in the plugin's `/templates/` folder. Override these templates within your theme
to fully customise the output.

The CSS is neutral and comes with very basic styling, so as to pick up your theme's default styles.The plugin CSS is
built using SASS, and the plugin comes with a Grunt build file, to compile the SASS into minified CSS, as well as
combine and minify all JavaScripts.

Copy the SASS files into your theme to generate CSS to override the plugin's default styles.

_TODO: Create an admin option to disable the inclusion of the plugin's default CSS._

##Font Awesome

This plugin includes a copy of Font Awesome, for its icons.

_TODO: Create an admin option to disable the inclusion of the plugin's fontawesome CSS._

##Caching

HTML5 localStorage, if present, is used to cache PageSpeed API call results, in order to reduce the number of calls
made to Google's API. Results are cached by page/url.
